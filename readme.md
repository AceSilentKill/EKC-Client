# Welcome to EKC CLient!
Founded 3/19/2024 we aim to provide the most user friendly and simple experience for anyone trying to play kour.io

## Getting started!
To get started head on over to the release tab and download the latest version.

You can choose between x64 x32 portable and installers. My reccomendation is to choose this for whichever version is the latest.

### After you install, the client has auto update so you shouldnt need to reinstall from the git page again!
